      <h2>What is Apollo?</h2>
      <p>
        Apollo is a service that brings professional music teachers to your
        office, to offer employees lessons during short breaks throughout the
        workday
      </p>

      <h2>Why at the office?</h2>
      <p>
        Many adults would like to learn to play an instrument, but they find
        that they don't have the <em>time</em> to go to lessons. Well, we've
        found the solution! We bring the teachers to you! Once a week, take a
        break to have your lesson with zero inconvenience
      </p>

      <h2>For music teachers</h2>
      <p>
        Music teachers often struggle with awkward work schedules, such as after
        kids are done with school, and gaps between students. Struggle no more!
        As an Apollo affiliate, we match up teachers with businesses to provide
        full teaching schedules during the workday, offering plenty of students
        at the same location and during sane work hours, leaving your evenings
        free!

      <h2>Can my company offer this?</h2>
      <p>We sure hope so! <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJ16X33irUjgdUqmvhKYIaglCSOg6ojP6Cx3qp0oaLStTdiA/viewform">Click here</a> to let us know!</p>
